# Star Rating Display Fix

## The Problem
When you set a rating of 4.3, all 5 stars were showing as filled instead of showing 4 filled stars and 1 empty star.

## The Issue
The original logic was:
```javascript
const isFilled = i < Math.floor(rating);  // 0,1,2,3 = true (4 stars)
const isPartial = i === Math.floor(rating) && rating % 1 !== 0;  // 4 = true (partial)
fill={isFilled || isPartial ? "currentColor" : "none"}  // Both filled!
```

This made BOTH filled stars AND partial stars show as filled (yellow).

## The Fix
New logic:
```javascript
const isFilled = i < Math.floor(rating);  // 0,1,2,3 = true (4 filled stars)
const isEmpty = i >= Math.ceil(rating);   // 5+ = true (empty stars)
fill={isFilled ? "currentColor" : "none"}  // Only filled stars are yellow
stroke="currentColor"
strokeWidth={isEmpty ? 1.5 : 0}  // Empty stars have outline
```

## How It Works Now

### Rating: 4.3
- Star 0: Filled ⭐ (i=0 < 4)
- Star 1: Filled ⭐ (i=1 < 4)
- Star 2: Filled ⭐ (i=2 < 4)
- Star 3: Filled ⭐ (i=3 < 4)
- Star 4: Outlined ☆ (i=4 >= 5 is false, but not filled)

### Rating: 5.0
- All 5 stars: Filled ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Rating: 3.7
- Stars 0-2: Filled ⭐⭐⭐
- Stars 3-4: Outlined ☆☆

### Rating: 2.0
- Stars 0-1: Filled ⭐⭐
- Stars 2-4: Outlined ☆☆☆

## Files Updated
1. `src/components/ProductDetailClient.tsx` - Product detail page stars
2. `src/components/ProductCatalog.tsx` - Product card stars

## Test It
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check the product with rating 4.3
3. You should now see 4 filled stars and 1 outlined star
4. The number "4.3" should still display correctly

Now the stars accurately represent the rating! ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
