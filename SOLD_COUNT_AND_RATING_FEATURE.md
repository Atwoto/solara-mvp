# Sold Count & Rating Feature - Implementation Guide

## What Was Added

A complete social proof system with sold count and customizable ratings that your admin can manage from the backend. Similar to AliExpress/Amazon style.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (`add_sold_count_migration.sql`)

- Added `sold_count` column (INTEGER, nullable)
- Added `rating` column (DECIMAL 2,1, nullable, range 0.0-5.0)
- Both columns nullable by default (NULL = don't show)
- Added indexes for better performance
- Added constraint to ensure rating is between 0 and 5

### 2. Type Definition (`src/types.ts`)

- Added `sold_count?: number | null;` to Product interface
- Added `rating?: number | null;` to Product interface

### 3. Admin Form (`src/components/admin/ProductForm.tsx`)

- Added "Social Proof" section with two fields:
  - **Units Sold**: Number input for sold count
  - **Rating (0-5)**: Number input with 0.1 step increments
- Both fields are optional (leave empty to hide)
- Form handles nullable values correctly
- Located in the right sidebar below "Organization"

### 4. Product Catalog Display (`src/components/ProductCatalog.tsx`)

- Shows star rating + sold count below product name
- Stars display based on actual rating (filled/outlined)
- Only displays when `sold_count` is not null/undefined
- Format: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 450 sold"

### 5. Product Detail Page (`src/components/ProductDetailClient.tsx`)

- Shows star rating + numeric rating + sold count
- Stars display based on actual rating value
- Displays below price with a divider line
- Format: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 | 450 sold"

## How to Use (For Your Admin)

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

In your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `add_sold_count_migration.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 2: Add Sold Count & Rating to Products

Your admin can now edit products and add these values:

#### In Admin Panel:

1. Go to `/admin/products`
2. Click "Edit" on any product
3. Scroll to the "Social Proof" section (right sidebar)
4. Enter values:
   - **Units Sold**: e.g., 450, 1200, 3500 (leave empty to hide)
   - **Rating**: e.g., 4.8, 4.5, 5.0 (leave empty to show 5.0 by default)
5. Click "Update Product"

#### For New Products:

1. Go to `/admin/products/new`
2. Fill in all product details
3. In "Social Proof" section, add sold count and rating
4. Click "Create Product"

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
rmdir /s /q .next
npm run dev
```

## Examples

### Popular Product

- **Sold Count**: 1,250
- **Rating**: 4.8
- **Display**: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 | 1,250 sold"

### New Product (Don't Show)

- **Sold Count**: Leave empty
- **Rating**: Leave empty
- **Display**: Nothing shown (clean look)

### Moderately Popular

- **Sold Count**: 150
- **Rating**: 4.5
- **Display**: "⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ 4.5 | 150 sold"

### Perfect Rating

- **Sold Count**: 500
- **Rating**: 5.0 (or leave empty)
- **Display**: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5.0 | 500 sold"

## Design Details

### Product Cards (Catalog View)

- Small stars (3.5px)
- Compact text: "450 sold"
- Positioned below product name
- Yellow stars (#FBBF24)
- Filled stars for rating, outlined for empty

### Product Detail Page

- Larger stars (5px)
- Shows numeric rating + sold count
- Format: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 | 450 sold"
- Has a bottom border for visual separation

## Important Notes

1. **No Default Zero**: Products without values won't show anything (as requested)
2. **Admin Controlled**: Your client can add/edit both values from the admin panel
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing products without these fields work fine
4. **Performance**: Indexed for fast queries
5. **Validation**: Rating must be between 0.0 and 5.0
6. **Flexible**: Can show sold count without rating, or vice versa

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Auto-increment sold_count when orders are completed
- Customer review system with actual ratings
- Admin dashboard showing best-selling products
- Bulk update tool for sold counts
- Analytics on conversion rates with/without social proof
